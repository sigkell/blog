It’s _finally_ happening. Attempt #2.

**There’s a blog.**

I’ve promised myself, and others, that I would have a blog set up an embarassingly long time ago. As standard, life gets in the way and I don’t always get to begin projects in the timeframe I set out. There were other high-priority tasks on my mental to-do list also.

This blog is bare-bones, and I intend on keeping it that way. Technology-wise, it’s powered by Hugo along with a very simple theme I created. I don’t feel the need to have too many fancy features, implementing them would likely get in the way of me actually writing content.

## What's it for?

Anything and everything, I suppose. This blog will mainly focus around my own interests in computing, photography, music, college life, and current affairs.

## `whoami`

I’m a human (or so reCAPTCHA tells me), and my pronouns are he/him. As of this post, I study Computer Science in University College, Cork (UCC). A lot of my extracurricular work starting with college focussed around societies and student media. I’ve previously been involved with a variety of societies, and co-founded the UCC Vegan Society. I’ve also had involvement with Motley Magazine (where I did lots of fun design work, but unfortunately it wasn’t deployed as I’d planned).

I like designing and building things that help improve people’s lives, and I hope that the content I post here will serve to advance that goal.

## The name. Explain it.

It’s the handle I go by online, primarily. It’s a portmanteau of `SIGKILL` (the *nix signal that causes the immediate termination of a process, more on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(IPC)#SIGKILL)) and my last name, Kelleher.

`SIGKILL` + Kelleher = SIGKELL.

## How do I contact you?

My primary email is fionn -> sigkell <`> xyz. You can usually find me lurking on [freenoe](https://freenode.net) under the same pseudonym.
